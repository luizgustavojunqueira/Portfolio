This is a repository to store my Portfólio. It is a simple project developed with ReactJS and TypeScript to show my projects, skills and talk a little about me.

This project is available at [My Portfólio](https://portfolio-luizgustavojunqueiras-projects.vercel.app/).

## Technologies

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS)

I didn't use any CSS framework, I prefered to write my own CSS since it is a small project and I wanted to practice my CSS skills.
