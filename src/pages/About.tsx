                        Hello! My name is Luiz Gustavo S. S. Junqueira. I am a
                        20-year-old Computer Science student at the Federal
                        University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am interested in automation, robotics, and software
                        development in general. Currently, I have been
                        dedicating myself to studying backend development, but I
                        also have experience and interest in frontend.
                        Additionally, I work on projects involving IoT and
                        embedded systems, such as autonomous drones and remote
                        monitoring solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in the power of technology to create
                        innovative and impactful solutions, and I am always
                        seeking to learn and apply new tools and methodologies
                        in my projects.
